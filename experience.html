        <ul>
          <li><p>Work on two medical AI product lines: a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device for diabetes management and screening; and a CNN retina scan for the screening of diabetic retinitis/diabetes.  </p></li>
          <li><p>Built a Python module with prototypes of several CGM algorithms, including sensor calibration, signal filtering and smoothing, signal artifact and dropout detection, an ARIMA forecasting model for predicting hyperglycemic/hypoglycemic events, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, and SVM classifiers to identify diabetic and pre-diabetic patients.  </p></li>
          <li><p>Wrote a CGM algorithm literature review that summarized recent articles. Covered high level algorithm explanations, current implementations, practices and results in industry and academia. Focused on RNN and LSTM deep learning models.  </p></li>
          <li><p>Helped design the terms for a revenue sharing scheme in which an industry-leading medical camera manufacturer provides fundus cameras to our retina scan client clinics in exchange for a share of revenues. The camera company agreed to a validation pilot program, and most clinics have been able to ramp up scan throughput to profitable levels. I serve as a contact point for this camera manufacturer, and I gather data from our client clinics and prepare monthly reports on the pilot program. Preliminary results are positive, and the program will be expanded in 2021.</p></li>
