          <h5><b>Domain</b>: Cross-platform iOS and Android app development, full-stack development, OOP, API integration</h5>
          <h5><b>Stack</b>: Angular JS, Ionic, Google Maps API, Firebase DB/Auth, HTML, CSS, SCSS </h5>

          <h5><b>Info</b>: Travel App is a cross platform mobile app that allows users to search a map of any city for nearby tourist spots which are fetched from Google Maps API. This app utilizes persistant user data storage by allowing users to save a list of locations to their profile as a "tour". Each tour contains information about distance, time, and cost for each location and for the entire tour, as well as recomended transportation routes fetched from the Google Maps API. This app also has social features that allow users to share their tours and view and review tours from other users. This app is not 100% complete and it has not been released in any app store, but we have most of the core functionality built. You can demo this app by downloading the code from the GitHub repo, installing ionic into the project folder and running "ionic serve" in your terminal from the project folder.</h5>

        <h3>Panoramic photo tool using RANSAC algorithm and cylindrical mapping</h3>
        <div id='projectInnerText'>
          <h5><b>Domain</b>: Computational photography, machine learning, functional programming, geometry</h5>
          <h5><b>Stack</b>: MATLAB</h5>
          <img src='./panoramic.jpg'>
          <h5><b>Info</b>: This program takes as input a sequence of photographs where the right portion of each image overlaps with the left portion of the next image, and outputs one panoramic image stitched together from each of the images in the sequence. First, each of the images is mapped onto a cylinder that simulates the cylindrical field of view that is created by standing in one place and rotating 360 degrees. This allows for objects that are in the center of one photograph but in the periphery of the next photograph to appear to at the same size and distance in each photograph.  The RANSAC algorithm then detects the portions of the photos that overlap and conjoins the two images together by setting the color of each pixel in the overlapping region as the average color of the corresponding pixels from each of the two images. The program finally uses Gaussian filtering to smooth out the pixels around the seams where the overlapping regions end. If you have MATLAB installed on your computer, you can download the code and execute it on your own sequence of photos.<h5>

          <h5><b>Domain</b>: front-end design, web development</h5>
          <h5><b>Stack</b>: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap</h5>
          <h5><b>Info</b>: I have not spent a lot of time mastering front-end design. My skillset is full-stack but strongly leaning towards backend. However, I do think deeply about high level program design, including interface layout, functionality, navigation, and visual aesthetics. Even though I majored in CS, this is actually my first webstite. It is just a simple HTML skeleton, but I had fun playing with color and styling and learning some new skills. I used Bootstrap to make the site responsive.</h5>
